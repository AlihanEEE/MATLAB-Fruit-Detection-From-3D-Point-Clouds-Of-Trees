Development of a robust fruit detection system is important for both yield estimation and
robotic harvesting in fruit orchards. In this project, we are expected to work on
detection of fruits from 3D point clouds of fruit trees. An indispensable part of the project
will be to obtain ground truth by manually labeling fruits using 3D model editing software
such as CloudCompare or MeshLab. We will conduct a survey on the state-
of-the-art methods for detection of objects from point clouds. We will select one or two
of these methods and apply them to the problem of fruit detection. We will also modify
these methods in order to decrease the error rate.
